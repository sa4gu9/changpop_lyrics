Sitting in front of the faded screen, I rub my tired eyes
My youth, my passion, all dedicated to the Maple World
Only a bitter feeling lingers
Where did things go wrong?
When did things start to change like this?

Oh! Do you remember?
How pure we were..
Meso were just numbers; what mattered were our memories

Oh! Do you remember?
How we laughed over a single mushroom
But now, Maple is filled with madness

Hiding in the darkness, a shadow chasing meso
Rice monkey. Because of you, Maple has lost its light
Please stop now... I have already normalized the Reboot server
I hope you pay some attention to our BM

Come back, our heroes
True adventure, pure passion
I want to feel it once again

Oh! Do you remember?
How we used to get excited over a single skill
But now people have left
and all that's left is an empty shell

Oh! Do you remember?
When there were no server conflicts?
Will I never see the MapleStory I loved again?
I knew it, I didn't want it to be this way either
The public's trust was shattered by rigged probabilities I didn't even manipulate
I had no choice but to destroy the Reboot server to win back their hearts
Sorry.. I'm sorry

Is it too late now?
Have we reached a point of no return?
I'll try my best so we can all smile together once again..
