Caught in the web of this so-called "normalcy"
They whisper "health", but it's all just hypocrisy.
"Meven Nam" controls the scene,
While "God Changseop" stays unseen.
The promises, they fall apart,
As "Cube rates" break our hearts.

They claim it's all for us,
But we see through the dust.
We're drowning in their lies,
Underneath a broken sky.

Lost in the echoes of deceit,
Trapped in the cycle, can't retreat.
"Reboot" cries, but they don't hear,
"Normalization" fuels the fear.
"Rice Bugs" feast on hopes once bright,
But we'll fight through this endless night.

"Health ad lib" they preach, while "fines" roll in,
But "God Changseop's" mask is wearing thin.
"Meven Nam" laughs as we fall,
"Reboot's" rise means nothing at all.
They say it's just the cost of play,
But we're the ones who've lost our way.
Caught between their greed and lies,
Watching as our future dies.

Lost in the echoes of deceit,
Trapped in the cycle, can't retreat.
"Reboot" cries, but they don't hear,
"Normalization" fuels the fear.
"Rice Bugs" feast on hopes once bright,
But we'll fight through this endless night.

We'll fight through this endless night.

Lost in the echoes of deceit,
Trapped in the cycle, can't retreat.
"Reboot" cries, but they don't hear,
"Normalization" fuels the fear.
"Rice Bugs" feast on hopes once bright,
But we'll fight through this endless night.

Lost in the echoes of deceit,
Trapped in the cycle, can't retreat.
"Reboot" cries, but they don't hear,
"Normalization" fuels the fear.
"Rice Bugs" feast on hopes once bright,
But we'll fight through this endless night.

"Reboot's too strong," they scream and shout,
"Let's bring them down, let's push them out."
But behind the scenes, the truth unfolds,
It's just their greed, their lies, their gold.

We're rising up, we see it clear,
No more hiding, no more fear.

Lost in the echoes of deceit,
Trapped in the cycle, can't retreat.
"Reboot" cries, but they don't hear,
"Normalization" fuels the fear.
"Rice Bugs" feast on hopes once bright,
But we'll fight through this endless night.

"God Changseop," your time is done,
We'll rise as one, the battle's won.
No more deceit, no more disguise,
We're breaking free, we'll claim the prize.
