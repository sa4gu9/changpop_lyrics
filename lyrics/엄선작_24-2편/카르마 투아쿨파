Used to keep it cool
All about the bounce in my step
Watch it on the Video
Whatcha gonna do?
What should I do?

I don't know why I run away
I don't know why I acted that way
But now it's too late to run
I don't do the middle or a little

KARMA

They praying for the death of a Maple
Spear the sympathy
Everybody my enemy
But freeload sweeter than caramel
If someone tries to take down game
Now you're one of them

They can't stop it now
And they might think I'm in a bind
Been through it, know the end
Open wide Utopia, You chose the Dystopia
Doubt is never an option, so truth's not a real phobia
Restart's slow, Killing Reboot's the flow.
Spammed 70 pages worth of posts in the community
Defeated the boss and freeloaded
Ruined the game's image
It's all of you
Wait what did I say?

KARMA

They praying for the death of a Maple
Spear the sympathy
Everybody my enemy
But freeload sweeter than caramel
If someone tries to take my job
Now you're one of them
For some, it's a Return of the Obra Dinn
For some, it's The Diary of Anne Frank
For some, it's Memories of Murder

"It's all your karma."
